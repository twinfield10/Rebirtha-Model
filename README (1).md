  # Model Methodlology
  
  ## What's the Goal? ##
To create a more accurate win percentage than sportsbooks for each baseball team in each MLB game using a variety of sources and models. In assuming that my model is more accurate at predicting the result of an MLB game, the model's outcome will trigger a bet on my end. Bets will be place in proporition to the degree in which the model's probability is greater than the moneyline's probability. The goal is to maintain long-term success by consistently beating the sports betting market by eliminating recency bias and relying on advanced statistical techniques.

  ## Where is the Code? ##
I have decided to keep my code proprietary for now. In the sports gambling world, everyone looks for an edge. As I have found my advantage, I will be keeping it under wraps for now. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
